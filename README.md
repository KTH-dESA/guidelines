# KTH-dES Scripts and Software Curation Guidelines

## How to make a script citable

An overview:

1. Create a new public repository under your own Github user account or KTH-dESA for the script and upload it with a permission open-source license
2. Log in to Zenodo using your Github account
3. Sync the repository on Zenodo
4. Create a Github release
5. You now have an software archive on Zenodo with a citable DOI for the release

See the Github documentation on [making you code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

## How to document your code

If you are working with Python, there are powerful approaches that enable documentation to be embedded in your code.
These "docstrings" can be automatically extracted by Sphinx and rendered as web documentation or compiled into a PDF.

### Docstrings (Python)
A "docstrings" is added in the function to e.g. describe what the function does, parameters, if it returns any parameter.
To generate an initial docstring in your function you can write """ or ''' and then Press enter and it will generate the parameters in the function and also what parameter is  returned. If you document the code following the automated syntax it can then be generated by [Sphinx] (https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)

Here is an example of the format the docstring need to be in so that Sphinx can create documentation from it.

```"""[Summary]

:param [ParamName]: [ParamDescription], defaults to [DefaultParamVal]
:type [ParamName]: [ParamType](, optional)
...
:raises [ErrorType]: [ErrorDescription]
...
:return: [ReturnDescription]
:rtype: [ReturnType]
""" 
```

A `README.txt` or `README.md` file should always be written as the most fundamental documentation.

## Installing the right packages for your script (Python)

To make sure that the script that you have developed can be run properly it is good to make an environment file so that the right packages are installed.
Here is an example of an environment file (make sure to save it as .yml) with the name, which channel to download the packages from and dependencies.

```name: myenv
channels:
  - conda-forge   #this is the conda channel
dependencies:
  - python>3.7
  - numpy=1.20.2
  - pandas=1.2.4
  - pytest=6.2.3
 ```

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/guidelines/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/guidelines/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
