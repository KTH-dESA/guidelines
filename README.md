# KTH-dES Scripts and Software Curation Guidelines

## How to make a script citable

An overview:

1. Create a new public repository under your own Github user account or KTH-dESA for the script and upload it with a permission open-source license
2. Log in to Zenodo using your Github account
3. Sync the repository on Zenodo
4. Create a Github release
5. You now have an software archive on Zenodo with a citable DOI for the release

See the Github documentation on [making you code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

## How to document your code

If you are working with Python, there are powerful approaches that enable documentation to be embedded in your code.
These "docstrings" can be automatically extracted by Sphinx and rendered as web documentation or compiled into a PDF.

A `README.txt` or `README.md` file should always be written as the most fundamental documentation.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/guidelines/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/guidelines/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
